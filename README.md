# Purpose
Exercise is help us demonstrate our ability to change and manipulate dataframes with functions such as groupby, pivot tables, and resampling.

Example uses sales data provided which will be used to gain insight into which cities in the US have sold the most athletic wear over two years.

We are to determine which retailers had the greatest total sales for athletic wear, and which retailers sold the most women's athletic footwear. Lastly, we were to determine which day and week had the highest sales for women's athletic footwear.

# Works Cited

Inspiration from work mostly came from various activities in Module 5. 

Xpert Learning Assistant was utilized for questions regarding formatting DateTime.

Documentation from Pandas website, pandas.pydata.org/docs was used.

Guidance from TA was utilized for guidance during an extra class session on 3/23/24.

AskBCSLearning Assistant was used. First in a chat, then over Zoom. This is where my usage of the "error coerce" argument came from. 

# Questions/Concerns for Grader

Notes on starter code for the questions regarding binning daily and weekly ask us to resample in Ascending order. However, documentation from Bootcamp website on the Module 5 exerciese ask us to sort in Descending order, which gives us the chart the documentation asks for.
